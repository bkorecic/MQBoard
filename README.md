# MQBoard
A WIP minimalistic, Qt-based scribbling board application.

## Why?
I have used many different whiteboard software for online teaching,
yet I haven't found one that suits my needs.

My ideal whiteboard app has the following features:
* Fully configurable keybindings.
* Distraction free mode, no GUI buttons.
* Clipboard image pasting.
* Transform and move selections.
